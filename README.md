# COST OF LIVING VERSUS PURCHASING POWER

This chart compares the top 10 countries with the highest cost of living index to their local purchasing power index. The data was collected by Numbeo, the largest provider of cost of living data in the world. Included in the data are indices such as the cost of living (excluding rent), the rent index, groceries, restaurants, the cost of living (including rent), and the local purchasing power. All indices are relative to the city of New York. A country with a cost of living index of 120, for example, is 20% more expensive than New York. Similarly, if the local purchasing power of a country is 40, then residents with an average salary in that country can afford 60% fewer goods and services than residents with an average salary in New York City. Here is a description of the data in great detail (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/cpi_explained.jsp)
